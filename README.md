# spinn_link_reflector
this module contains code to use an algorithm to place routing table entries that ensure all packets coming into spinnaker via the SpiNNlinks are sent directly back out the same SpiNNLink. It allows verification of the FPGA code that it can recieve and send MC packets correctly.
